# Implemented Documentation - Consolidated

This file consolidates the documentation pages that are marked as implemented in the repository. It gathers the core implemented features (authentication, patients & clinical notes, search indexing jobs, and related epic overviews) to make it easier to read and track what's already delivered.

## Index
- Authentication System (Epic 2)
- Patients Frontend (T-303)
- Prontuário Eletrônico (T-304)
- Search Indexing Jobs (T-306)
- Epic Summaries (Épicos 2 & 3)

If you want, I can:

- Expand this consolidated file with direct extracts (APIs, examples, and code snippets) from each doc.
- Create a `docs/IMPLEMENTED_INDEX.md` with links and a short checklist per item.
- Mark the individual source docs with a small front-matter badge to indicate "Merged into IMPLEMENTED_DOCUMENTATION.md".
